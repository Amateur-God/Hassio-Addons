### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Home Assistant installed.
- Make sure your Android devices have ADB debugging enabled.
  - On the Android device, go to `Settings > About phone` and tap `Build number` seven times to enable developer mode.
  - Go to `Settings > Developer options` and enable `USB debugging` or `Wireless debugging`.

### Installation

1. **Add the Repository to Home Assistant:**
   - In Home Assistant, go to `Supervisor > Add-on Store`.
   - Click the three-dot menu at the top right and select `Repositories`.
   - Add the following URL: `https://github.com/Amateur-God/Hassio-Addons`.

2. **Install the ADB-Server Add-on:**
   - Find the ADB-Server add-on in the list and click on it.
   - Click on the `Install` button.

3. **Configure the Add-on:**
   - Go to the `Configuration` tab.
   - Edit the `config.json` to include the IP addresses of your Android devices and any other required configuration. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "devices": [
         {
           "name": "Living Room TV",
           "ip": "192.168.1.100"
         },
         {
           "name": "Bedroom Tablet",
           "ip": "192.168.1.101"
         }
       ],
       "additional_config": "your_additional_config_here"
     }
     ```
   - Save the configuration.

4. **Start the Add-on:**
   - Go to the `Info` tab and click the `Start` button.
   - Optionally, enable the `Start on boot` option to ensure the add-on starts automatically when Home Assistant starts.

5. **Access the Ingress Terminal:**
   - Once the add-on is running, click on `Open Web UI` to access the ingress terminal.
   - You can now execute ADB commands directly from the terminal.

### Example Commands

  adb devices
  ```

- **Install an APK:**
  ```sh
  adb -s <device_ip> install /path/to/app.apk
  ```

- **Send a Key Event:**
